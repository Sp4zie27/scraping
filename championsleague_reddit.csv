The whole team failed, the attack was non existent, the midfield was barely there, defense was leaky. Liverpool were dominated harder than what they did to Madrid in 2022, ironically also in Paris and ironically also saved by another GK, but even then they had more chances then and starting players stepping up.

Liverpool had 0.00xG and no shots on target until the goal, were brutally dominated and barely surviving leaking chances left and right, didn't even have a good low block. Alisson made the most obscene world class saves one after the other, single handedly keeping them in the game, and then the goal came from his pinpoint pass to one sub and scored by Elliott who came in 40sec earlier. No one of the starting 11 besides him was even involved in that goal. I am trying to accentuate how completely outplayed the team was, to the point that even the goal came from Alisson + subs and was the only time they had a shot on goal.

Naturally there are a ton of Messi and Ronaldo/Neymar/Neuer/Bale performances but all I can think of the team as a whole was at the very least playing decently, and even if they scored 5 it wasnt exactly  winning the game alone as other players stepped up. Here even the goal was created by Alisson and finished by subs, genuinely unbelievable impact.

Interested in what you remember, stats to go along with the game would be useful.

Edit: As usual a ton of people making bold statements but providing no examples. The only game anyone else mentioned is Courtois or some attacker that scored 3 goals in a game that their team dominated, not a carry is it? We are talking about a game performance not impact, regardless whether it's a final or a group stage game. 

Courtois is close but his attackers showed up, they literally scored 2 goals, one shouldn't have been disallowed, and he had no part in any of them. So in Alisson's case everyone was shit and he made the goal with his pass and no starting player was involved in it, with Courtois the attackers were good and Vinicius, Benzema and Valverde showed up and scored twice. Which one of those seems more impressive?"

1. Kvaratshkelia disallowed goal: I hate when VAR disallows goals by such tiny margins. In my opinion the offside rule should be that if any part of your body is aligned with the defender then it‚Äôs onside, not that if any tiny part is past the defender then it‚Äôs offside.

2. That push from Konate was a clear foul. Stupid English commentators say it was shoulder to shoulder, but if it was shoulder to shoulder Barcola wouldn‚Äôt fall forward‚Ä¶ Konate pushed him from behind, and the ball was infront of Barcola‚Ä¶ should‚Äôve been a red

Going with a classic 433.

Let me know if you think I‚Äôve missed anyone, and happy to hear your own thoughts and teams.

GK: Casillas - Their greatest ever goalkeeper and the only real contender over this period.

DR: Carvajal - Salgado and Azpilicueta were both great, but Carvajal‚Äôs sheer trophy haul and managing to score in last year‚Äôs final puts him on top for me.

DL: Alba - Spain have had some underrated left backs, but only one world class one has actually won the competition.

DCs: Ramos and Puyol - Ramos is arguably the greatest defender of his generation and has so many crucial goals in the UCL, while Puyol was a rock for Barca who provided grit and leadership. Hierro was close to making it, being a key player in 3 UCL wins, as was Pique, but those 2 stand out for me.

DM: Busquets - A unique talent who made recycling possession and beating the press look effortless. Alonso had a better passing range and Rodri has the Ballon D‚ÄôOr, but Busquets is still the best DM I have ever seen.

MCs: Xavi and Iniesta - Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much to say here, they‚Äôre arguably Spain‚Äôs greatest 2 ever players and together with Busquets are the best midfield trio I‚Äôve seen. 

RW: Mata - Probably the most controversial pick in this team. The ideal option would be David Silva but he never won the UCL. Pedro is underrated and Guti had plenty of moments of magic, but I don‚Äôt think either of them hit the peaks that Mata did at Chelsea. 

LW: Villa - He played here for Barca which lets me put another player upfront. Isco was amazing for Madrid, especially in 2017, but overall Villa had the better career and was key to Spain‚Äôs World Cup win.

ST: Raul - One of the greatest goalscorers both Madrid and the UCL have seen, and also one of the most complete strikers. A shame he missed out on the golden era of the national team, but at least he got a fun run to the semifinals of the UCL with Schalke in 2011.

Manager: Pep - Didn‚Äôt do this segment for the England XI since none of their managers have won it in the stipulated timeframe. Pep is unquestionably one of the greatest managers of all time, and has cemented himself as one of the most tactically influential managers of the era, taking the ideas of Cruyff and breathing new life into them wherever he goes. He‚Äôs obviously had his struggles recently, but 3 UCLs place him above the other contenders. Benitez had a phenomenal comeback in 2005, but never really reached the heights of Pep, while Del Bosque for me is just Pep without the tactical innovation, with his greatest achievements relying on world class individuals and predecessors such as Heynckes and Aragones. Still a brilliant facilitator of teams, but Pep is probably the manager of the century thus far."

The team largely picks itself. Have gone with a 4231 formation given the sacred nature of the 10 role in French football, with the biggest legends for the national team including Kopa, Platini, and Zidane.

GK: Barthez - Only had 1 real choice in goal, he won with Marseille in 1993 and gave me heart attacks as a childhood United fan. Eccentric but undoubtedly talented, and his agility and reflexes helped him overcome his height issues.

DR: Sagnol - Scintillating wing back with superb crossing and was important to so many Bayern attacks. Unfortunate to have been in the same era as Thuram for France, but at least he‚Äôs won the UCL. Angloma gets an honourable mention.

DL: Evra - France have plenty of options here including Lizarazu and Abidal, but Evra‚Äôs ability to contribute on both ends on the pitch and leadership qualities see him just pip the others. Any man who isn‚Äôt afraid of raw chicken is welcome in my team.

DCs: Desailly and Varane - A pairing of these 2 would be magnificent, Desailly was a rock who could marshal a defence and Varane was a real Rolls Royce defender with great pace. 

DMs: Makelele and Kante - Another great pairing, Kante always thrived with a sitter next to him allowing him to showcase his qualities on the ball and roam around to hound the opposition. I do feel Makelele gets overhyped over having the position named after him, but he was critical to Madrid‚Äôs successes under Del Bosque. 

AM: Zidane. Absolute magic on the ball. Wasn‚Äôt always the most consistent, but one of those rare players who could make you gasp.

RW: Ribery - He played better on the left, but I‚Äôve shifted him here to fit more players in and France didn‚Äôt have a better alternative. A creative genius who could rip through defences. 

LW: Henry - I usually despise anyone that shifts Henry to the LW position in these kinds of XIs, but there weren‚Äôt many great winger options. A shame that him and Zidane never linked up properly on the pitch.

ST: Benzema - Regardless of the 15 jokes, Benzema was brilliant for Madrid in both facilitating and scoring goals, and had the greatest UCL campaign of all time in 2022. Anelka deserves an honourable mention here.

Manager: Zidane - Only guy who qualifies to be here, and is apparently managing himself. Only manager to have won the UCL 3 times in a row, with other 3 in a rows usually interrupted by a managerial change eg Michels and Kovacs at Ajax. "

I went with 4231 formation here.

GK: Neuer - Already had to leave out an all time great in Kahn, as well as a very good goalkeeper in Ter Stegen, but Neuer is the defining goalie of his generation.

DR: Boateng - A bit of a rogue shout for right back, but I had to play the best fit on the left. Still a wall for Bayern in the 2010s, though he‚Äôll always be remembered for being eviscerated by Messi. Reuter would have been a more natural fit but I personally have seen more of Boateng.

DL: Lahm - Capable of playing on either flank, if you‚Äôre described as the most intelligent player that Pep has ever managed, you‚Äôre probably getting in the team.

DCs: Sammer and Kohler - Kohler was an old school aggressive man marker who managed to get the approval of the Italians, and Sammer was a brilliant sweeper and the standout player in the 1996 Euros. In my mind, Lahm can invert into midfield or stretch play depending on the game, while Boateng tucks in on the right, allowing Sammer to sweep up. Rudiger was close to getting in, but his lack of success at the international level means these 2 are my picks for now.

MCs: Kroos and Schweinsteiger - So many great players that missed out, such as Effenberg, Gundogan, Kimmich, and even Goretzka and Khedira. Kroos is a non-negotiable for me given the sheer number of UCLs he has won and the quality he shows on the ball, while Schweinsteiger was the midfield engine for both 2013 Bayern and 2014 Germany.

AM: Moller - A great playmaker for Dortmund with surprising pace for an attacking midfielder. It was between him and Scholl for the 10 position, though I expect he‚Äôll do a lot of rotating with my wide options.

RW: Muller - How many players can create a new position for themselves? He‚Äôs not fast or strong, he‚Äôs not that technically gifted and he can‚Äôt really beat a man, but his intelligence, movement and work rate helped establish him as a new breed of forward. 

LW: Gnabry - The trio behind the striker is a bit of a mess, with Gnabry best on the right and the other 2 best down the middle. In any case, he was prolific for a good few years and his pace can help stretch out defences.

ST: Gomez - I almost put Gundogan as a false 9 until I remembered that Gomez was still on the bench for Bayern‚Äôs 2013 win. A great target man who helped fire Stuttgart to a Bundesliga before moving to Bayern, where he scored 113 goals in 174 games. Has a great song in his honour as well. 

Manager: Hitzfeld - All due respect to Klopp, but Hitzfeld actually managed to deliver the UCL to Dortmund and followed it up with Bayern. "

Have adjusted the formation to a 343 with a 10.

GK: Toldo - Was surprised to learn he was on the bench for the 2010 win, I originally thought of Peruzzi with Juventus but Toldo was heroic for Italy during the 2000 Euros.

DR: Panucci - One of the rare Italian players to have played for Madrid, and won 2 UCLs with them and Milan. He was also pretty prolific for a fullback.

DL: Maldini - One of the greatest defenders of all time, enough said.

DCs: Nesta, Costacurta, and Baresi - All were stalwarts for Milan at different points in time. Most of the great Italian centre backs actually never won the UCL, which is a shame. Ferrera was another option, and nearly made the team until I was reminded by u/jaumougaauco that Baresi was part of the 1994 squad. 

MCs: Pirlo and Gattuso - Both were key players of that great Milan side in the 2000s, and in this XI would provide a blend of silk and steel. Albertini would have been my pick if I opted for a midfield 3.

AM: Del Piero - Not quite a pure 10, but he was better as a deep lying forward and is Juve‚Äôs all time top scorer and appearance maker. Donadoni would have been a more natural fit but it‚Äôs hard to argue against Del Piero.

STs: Vialli and Inzaghi - Vialli was one of the great strikers of the 90s and led the line for Juve in their 1996 campaign, and Inzaghi scored both goals in the 2007 final. 

Manager: Ancelotti - Tactically flexible and a great man manager who has won 5 UCLs, the only other contenders are Capello and Lippi who while great, have never seen the sustained success of Don Carlo. "

Aside from some notable exceptions (Inter's win in 2010, two finals from Allegri's Juventus, a semifinal from Roma and again Inter's final in 2023), Italian teams have not kept pace with the growth of the EPL (thanks to massive investments, aggressive marketing and market penetration, common language worldwide, etc) and LaLiga (and I would say the Cr7-Messi duel has contributed at least to 75% to the globalization of LaLiga), and have been less relevant at the European stage than in the past.

What went wrong in Italy, is it just bad/late investments? They stayed too anchored to their glorious past? Do you believe they can still reemerge as a competitive league in Europe (I mean fanbase and goodwill of teams like Milan, Juve or Inter is huge, why wouldn't investors go there?!) or rather stay in this 3rd-4th European rank position split with Bundesliga because the financial gap with LaLiga and EPL is just too big?"

Seven matches, seven defeats: the record is more than mediocre for French clubs in a second leg at Liverpool. And Paris Saint-Germain can put an end to this bad run this Tuesday 11th of March, in the second leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie against the English outfit.

But for the seven defeats, two of them have to be seen in a different light. The endings were much happier. This was the case for PSG in April 1997, in the second leg of the Cup semi-finals. The capital club had won the first leg by three goals (3-0), even conceding two. The second came in the 80th minute, leaving Paris to qualify.

It was the same scenario for Strasbourg in November 1997, in the second leg of the UEFA Cup Round of 32. With the same three-goal cushion, Racing qualified for the next round.

Even so, it remains difficult to win at Anfield, the Reds' home ground. Over the current Premier League season, Liverpool have lost just one match at home. That was on September 14, 2024 against Nottingham. PSG will need to win at all costs, after the difficult 0-1 defeat they suffered in the first leg.

Let's be optimistic for tonight !!"
