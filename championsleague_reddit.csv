The whole team failed, the attack was non existent, the midfield was barely there, defense was leaky. Liverpool were dominated harder than what they did to Madrid in 2022, ironically also in Paris and ironically also saved by another GK, but even then they had more chances then and starting players stepping up.

Liverpool had 0.00xG and no shots on target until the goal, were brutally dominated and barely surviving leaking chances left and right, didn't even have a good low block. Alisson made the most obscene world class saves one after the other, single handedly keeping them in the game, and then the goal came from his pinpoint pass to one sub and scored by Elliott who came in 40sec earlier. No one of the starting 11 besides him was even involved in that goal. I am trying to accentuate how completely outplayed the team was, to the point that even the goal came from Alisson + subs and was the only time they had a shot on goal.

Naturally there are a ton of Messi and Ronaldo/Neymar/Neuer/Bale performances but all I can think of the team as a whole was at the very least playing decently, and even if they scored 5 it wasnt exactly  winning the game alone as other players stepped up. Here even the goal was created by Alisson and finished by subs, genuinely unbelievable impact.

Interested in what you remember, stats to go along with the game would be useful.

Edit: As usual a ton of people making bold statements but providing no examples. The only game anyone else mentioned is Courtois or some attacker that scored 3 goals in a game that their team dominated, not a carry is it? We are talking about a game performance not impact, regardless whether it's a final or a group stage game. 

Courtois is close but his attackers showed up, they literally scored 2 goals, one shouldn't have been disallowed, and he had no part in any of them. So in Alisson's case everyone was shit and he made the goal with his pass and no starting player was involved in it, with Courtois the attackers were good and Vinicius, Benzema and Valverde showed up and scored twice. Which one of those seems more impressive?"

1. Kvaratshkelia disallowed goal: I hate when VAR disallows goals by such tiny margins. In my opinion the offside rule should be that if any part of your body is aligned with the defender then it‚Äôs onside, not that if any tiny part is past the defender then it‚Äôs offside.

2. That push from Konate was a clear foul. Stupid English commentators say it was shoulder to shoulder, but if it was shoulder to shoulder Barcola wouldn‚Äôt fall forward‚Ä¶ Konate pushed him from behind, and the ball was infront of Barcola‚Ä¶ should‚Äôve been a red

Champions League winner that year? Bayern Munich

Champions League runner-up? Valencia

Euro 2000 winner? France

Euro 2000 runner-up? Italy

Patrick Kluivert and and Savo Milosevic were the highest scorers at the Euro.

But Oliver Kahn helped Bayern win the UCL.

Honestly, this was the perfect opportunity to give the Ballon d'Or to Oliver Kahn as no goalkeeper has won it since Lev Yashin and they gave it to...Michael Owen."

They could be winning on aggregate and often times it feels like they are going through but then somehow real Madrid turn it up to overcome the deficit. Why is that? Is it nervousness? A mental block? Why is it that they can‚Äôt close out games without giving away stupid fouls or making mistakes they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt?"
